<h3>Rules:</h3>
<ul class="padded">
    <li><strong>Be friendly!</strong> You don't have to be an angel but don't harass or insult other players in a way that would cause them emotional harm.</li>
    <li><strong>Be constructive!</strong> Most people spend quite a bit of time setting up their base and its various contraptions. Being told that it's ugly, inefficient or could be made better by another person doesn't foster a friendly environment. Stay constructive and first find out if the person wants help!</li>
    <li><strong>Respect other people's bases!</strong> If you encounter a base in your travels, give it the respect that you would want others to give yours. Do not loot from their chests, do not make modifications to their base, and avoid spending too much time inside of it.</li>
    <li><strong>Work together in common areas!</strong> While the world has a near infinite size, most of us will be sharing the same areas. This is especially true in the nether. Be prepared to work collaboratively when different players' projects share a common space.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep your animals under control!</strong> Living entities (animals and monsters) are the biggest use of CPU time. Unfortunately there isn't a number that I can say is too much, so this rule will be handled on a case-by-case basis.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not use a modded client in order to cheat!</strong> X-ray or any other mod that allows you to cheat in an obscene way is forbidden. This does not include minimap mods or any other mod that allows you to play the game as close to normal as possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't ask me for spoilers!</strong> I actively mod this server and I sometimes see changes that are not publicly known. If you pester me for information I'll likely lead you on a wild goose chase.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay aware of <em>forum</em> rules!</strong> Being on the BTW forums helps out all the BTW servers. Make sure to follow the forum rules when posting to the BTW forum thread.</li>
    <li><strong>Read the sub rules!</strong> Either read the sub-rule sections below (e.g. Rules for Building at Spawn) or at least be aware of what the rules apply to so you can come back and read them later.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rules for Building at Spawn:</h3>

<p>Please follow the rules below if you want to build at spawn. These rules are a WIP and will likely be expanded.</p>

<ul class="padded">
    <li><strong>Make your own base first!</strong> If you're new to the server, you should start by building your own base first. Give yourself a week or two to experience the server before building at spawn.</li>
    <li><strong>It should fit in!</strong> Spawn should feel like a town or small city. Buildings should be somewhat uniform in look and feel. Use varied materials in your building. Don't worry though if you don't feel like you have the aesthetic touch. Take a look around and get some ideas, and then take your best shot at it :)</li>
    <li><strong>No temporary structures!</strong> It's easy to forget about a temporary setup, or get distracted with another project. These things can build up and be a mess. Build your containing structure first, then put your various machinations inside.</li>
    <li><strong>Nothing too big!</strong> Unless it's a community project to build some kind of temple, buildings should be kept to small to medium homes or shops.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep your underground part under your building!</strong> You never know if your neighbor (or future neighbor) will need space under their building, so keep your underground setup within the borders of your top-side structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Make sure it looks good in the default texture pack!</strong> If your texture pack turns cobble into the finest european brownstone, then all your buildings are going to pretty ugly to most other people. Keep it simple and work with you have in the default texture pack :)</li>
</ul>
