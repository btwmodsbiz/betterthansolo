    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Welcome to the Better Than Solo server!</h3>
    <p>This is a friendly (non-anarchy) server set up shortly after Better Than Wolves went SMP, because it is way more fun to play BTW together! :)</p>
    <p>I'm actively modding the server in order to monitor performance and take action when something is slowing the server down. I've also made some changes which you can read about below.</p>
    <p>A big thank you to Lifewater for hosting the server and to FC for making BTW!</p>
    <p>This server was previously known as <a href="http://www.sargunster.com/btwforum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=5344" target="_blank">Lifewaters BTW Server</a>, and uses the same map.</p>
    <p>FYI: My in-game name is AndreM.</p>

<h3>Getting on the Whitelist:</h3>
<p>This server is for players of age 13 and over who have at least moderate experience with BTW. You know should know all the critical components (i.e. gearboxes) and know the dangers (i.e. hellfire dust). If you're new to the mod or not very experienced yet with BTW, please play a bit more in single player :) However, if you have an already whitelisted friend who will be guiding your adventure into the magics of BTW, have them contact me!</p>
<p>Please follow the steps below when requesting to be whitelisted:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Read the rules below. Read them again!</li>
    <li>Read the forum rules. Read those again!</li>
    <li>Read the "Guide for New Players" section below.</li>
    <li>Post a reply to this thread that includes your IGN and an introduction about yourself. I recommend a few sentences at a minimum. If you have less than 10 posts, please be as exhaustive as you can. The better the request the faster you get whitelisted! :)</li>
    <li>We're very diverse in age and location, so you may optionally include your age and country if you want others to know.</li>
    <li>If you are under the age of 18 please say so. However, including your actual age is still optional.</li>
    <li>Finally, make sure you indicate that you've read and agree to the rules in your request.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will let you know if your request does not meet any of the steps above. However, depending on the degree that was missed I may request that you take some extra steps before you're whitelisted :)</p>
<p>I normally search IGNs online for users with very low post counts, so if there is anything I should know about you may want to be upfront about it.</p>
<p>If I did not respond to your whitelist request, feel free to post a reply and let me know. However, please do not send me a PM.</p>

<h3>Guide for New Players:</h3>

<p>Since this was one of the first SMP servers, there is a fair bit of craziness around spawn.
There are lots of old bases and abandoned construction projects from when the server had 20-30 people online at once.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, I recommend taking a look around the spawn town. You are free to
take any supplies in chests that you can open (some are locked for players who build at spawn).
However, since they're intended to be starter supplies for new players, you shouldn't just empty them out.
Take what you need in the short term and leave the rest for players to come!</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, take a look at the server's <a href="http://server.betterthansolo.com/overview#/349/64/-132/-1/0/0">Overviewer Map</a>. Using the day/night toggle in the upper right, try to find a place on the map where there doesn't seem to be any lights on the surface. Then adventure to that area and start your base :)</p>

<p>If you're not sure what to do or you need help, feel free to post to the forum thread!</p>
