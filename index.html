    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Welcome to the Better Than Solo server!</h3>
    <p>This is a friendly (non-anarchy) server set up shortly after Better Than Wolves went SMP, because it is way more fun to play BTW together! :)</p>
    <p>I'm actively modding the server in order to monitor performance and take action when something is slowing the server down. I've also made some changes which you can read about below.</p>
    <p>A big thank you to Lifewater for hosting the server and to FC for making BTW!</p>
    <p>This server was previously known as <a href="http://www.sargunster.com/btwforum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=5344" target="_blank">Lifewaters BTW Server</a>, and uses the same map.</p>
    <p>FYI: My in-game name is AndreM.</p>

<h3>Getting on the Whitelist:</h3>
<p>This server is for players of age 13 and over who have at least moderate experience with BTW. You know should know all the critical components (i.e. gearboxes) and know the dangers (i.e. hellfire dust). If you're new to the mod or not very experienced yet with BTW, please play a bit more in single player :) However, if you have an already whitelisted friend who will be guiding your adventure into the magics of BTW, have them contact me!</p>
<p>Please follow the steps below when requesting to be whitelisted:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Read the rules below. Read them again!</li>
    <li>Read the forum rules. Read those again!</li>
    <li>Read the "Guide for New Players" section below.</li>
    <li>Post a reply to this thread that includes your IGN and an introduction about yourself. I recommend a few sentences at a minimum. If you have less than 10 posts, please be as exhaustive as you can. The better the request the faster you get whitelisted! :)</li>
    <li>We're very diverse in age and location, so you may optionally include your age and country if you want others to know.</li>
    <li>If you are under the age of 18 please say so. However, including your actual age is still optional.</li>
    <li>Finally, make sure you indicate that you've read and agree to the rules in your request.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will let you know if your request does not meet any of the steps above. However, depending on the degree that was missed I may request that you take some extra steps before you're whitelisted :)</p>
<p>I normally search IGNs online for users with very low post counts, so if there is anything I should know about you may want to be upfront about it.</p>
<p>If I did not respond to your whitelist request, feel free to post a reply and let me know. However, please do not send me a PM.</p>

<h3>Guide for New Players:</h3>

<div class="well well-small">
    <div><em>It has been a long journey to the new world. You disemark your ship and find yourself on docks leading up to a large building.</em></div>
    <div><strong>&lt;Dockmaster&gt;</strong> Welcome traveler! I can see it has been a long journey for you.</div>
    <div><strong>&lt;Dockmaster&gt;</strong> Perhaps a stiff drink to rejuvenate your soul? Head right up those stairs to the Time's End tavern.</div>
</div>

<p>Welcome to spawn town! It is intended to help new players get started and to act as a
life line for those who have died and need a bit of help getting back to their base.
If you're not sure what to do or you need help, feel free to post to the forum thread!</p>

<h4>Spawn Town</h4>

<p>Various supplies are available here to help you get started. While you are free to take any items you find
(some chests are locked to store spawn building supplies) it is best that you take just what you need and
leave the rest for players to come!</p>

<p>Different buildings store different supplies. For example, you can find free iron at the blacksmith and
gourmet meals at the cafe.</p>

        <div class="caption" style="text-align: center;">Inside are chests full of delicious meals!</div>
    </div></li>
</ul>

<h4>The Graveyard</h4>

<p>Of special interest in spawn town is a graveyard in the north east corner of town. </p>

<p>Players may use the &quot;services&quot; of the crypt to have their head removed. After that, you may place your head
on any gravestone. You can only place/remove your own head, so don't worry about anyone running off with it.</p>

</ul>

<h4>Finding Your New Home</h4>

<p>Since this was one of the first SMP servers, there is a fair bit of craziness around spawn.
There are lots of old bases and abandoned construction projects from when the server had 20-30 people online at once.</p>

<p>Using the server's <a href="http://server.betterthansolo.com/livemap/">world map</a> you can search for an
unoccupied location. The "Night" mode (in the upper left) as well as the marker and rail overlays can
help you determine if someone is already in a location.</p>

<p>A fairly large rail network has been build in the nether to help players travel to remote locations.
This rail network is represented on the world map using pink/grey rail icons as well as red lines.
The grey icons are the main rail stations at nether spawn.
The pink icons represent sub stations that have portals to the overworld.
The red lines represent the path the rail line takes in the nether. Use some iron from the blacksmith if you do not yet have a minecart.</p>

<p>So how do you get to the nether? That's entirely up to you to figured out.
On a complete unrelated note, there are rumors of men in black robes going into the basement of the tavern...</p>
