<h3>Extra Player Commands:</h3>

<ul class="padded">
    <li>Players can shorten URLs by pasting it in chat then pressing TAB, much like you would to
    auto complete someone's name. This only works for URLs that are 100 characters or less.</li>
    
    <li>A <code>/pvp</code> command has been added to allow players to engage in mortal combat!
        You can only engage other players who are PvP flagged.
        This only counts for hitting players with held items and arrows shot from player bows.
        Any remaining PvP time will be saved when you logout, and will resume when you return.
        Don't set the time too high unless you mean it! ;D</li>
        
    <li>An <code>/armor</code> (or <code>/armour</code>) command has been added to allow players to hide
    one or more armor pieces from other players. Most players have awesome skins and it's time we showed
    them off! SFS armor will always show. If you're PvP flagged your armor will also always show.</li>
    
    <li>A <code>/chatcolor</code> (or <code>/chatcolour</code>) command has been added to allow players
    to color their username in global chat. The colors are limited to what vMC supports, which you can
    view by using the <code>/chatcolor show</code> command. Black and navy are not allowed as they are
    a bit too dark. Type <code>/help chatcolor</code> to get help on its usage.</li>
    
    <li>A <code>/marker</code> command that allows players to add "points of interest" to the
    overviewer and live map. You can set up to 3 markers per dimension, and you must wait 30 minutes
    after setting a marker before you can set one again.
    
        <div style="margin: 8px 0 0 30px;">
            <p><strong>Examples of usage:</strong></p>
            
            <p>Set marker #1 to your current location:<br>
            <code>/marker set 1</code></p>
            
            <p>Set marker #2 to your current location as a "home":<br>
            <code>/marker set 2 home</code></p>
            
            <p>Set a description for Overworld marker #1:<br>
            <code>/marker description Overworld 1 This is my base!</code></p>
            
            <p>Remove the description from Nether marker #1 (use a single hyphen for the description):<br>
            <code>/marker description Nether 1 -</code></p>
            
            <p>Remove Overworld marker #1:<br>
            <code>/marker remove Overworld 1</code></p>
            
            <p>Remove The End marker #3:<br>
            <code>/marker remove TheEnd 3</code></p>
            
            <p>List all your markers:<br>
            <code>/marker list</code></p>
            
            <p>Show the usage for a subcommand:<br>
            <code>/marker help set</code></p>
        </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>A <code>/who</code> command has been added to list players who are online.
    For each player it will also display 1) the player's alias (see below) of one is set
    and 2) the number of minutes the player has been AFK if it has been over 5 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes to the World:</h3>

<ul class="padded">
    <li>Tamed wolves with white collars (use bone meal) will no longer follow you.
    This includes the teleport they do when you're beyond a maximum range. 
    This allows for friendly-looking wolf pens where the wolves can run around.</li>

    <li>Animal spawning has been changed so that animals influenced by players (breeding or chicken eggs)
    do not count toward the animal spawn cap. Animals can also only spawn during the day and in locations
    that have no block light (i.e. torches) at all. All animals before this change will automatically be marked
    as influenced by players, which may lead to some extra mobs in the wild. Happy hunting!</li>
    
    <li>The time until an animal starts following you (when you're holding something it likes) has been
    shortened, but it also has a bit of randomness now as well. This will prevent a group of animals
    from following you all at once, which looks very fake.</li>
    
    <li>Players can have their IGN's aliased so they appear as a different name. This is to allow those with usernames
    they did not intend to appear in multiplayer chat to look a bit better. For example, <code>someguy3914122</code> can be aliased to <code>someguy</code>.
    Please contact me if you would like this done.</li>
        
    <li>Enderchests that are unaltered by a beacon work as personal storage again.
    All other Enderchests changes added by FC are still in effect.</li>
    
    <li>Squid spawning has been limited so it cannot drastically pass the spawn limit when a lot of ocean chunks are loaded.
    This was causing a lot of needless tick time.</li>
    
    <li>When wolves are bred, there is a chance that the baby will be born wild! It has become difficult
    to find wolves on our server without going far out, so this should help.
    Note: wolves can only be bred by their owners.</li>
    
    <li>Spawn chunks are no longer always loaded. Many of us don't spend time there anyway,
    so might as well prevent it from using up resources.</li>
    
    <li>Several community areas near spawn are protected from anything that may change them.</li>
    
    <li>Chunks are randomly checked to see if they are not in range of a player (i.e. not within the 17x17 chunk range).
    If they are found to be out of range of a player, they are unloaded. This is done to avoid the large number of
    chunks that get stuck loaded over time.</li>
    
    <li>The spawn point is forced to always be at a specific location (the dock at the Time's End tavern) as well
    as a specific yaw and pitch (aka: the direction the player is looking).</li>
</ul>
