<h3>Extra Player Commands:</h3>

<ul class="padded">
    <li>A <code>/pvp</code> command has been added to allow players to engage in mortal combat!
        You can only engage other players who are PvP flagged.
        This only counts for hitting players with held items and arrows shot from player bows.
        Any remaining PvP time will be saved when you logout, and will resume when you return.
        Don't set the time too high unless you mean it! ;D</li>
        
    <li>An <code>/armor</code> (or <code>/armour</code>) command has been added to allow players to hide
    one or more armor pieces from other players. Most players have awesome skins and it's time we showed
    them off! SFS armor will always show. If you're PvP flagged your armor will also always show.</li>
    
    <li>A <code>/chatcolor</code> (or <code>/chatcolour</code>) command has been added to allow players
    to color their username in global chat. The colors are limited to what vMC supports, which you can
    view by using the <code>/chatcolor show</code> command. Black and navy are not allowed as they are
    a bit too dark. Type <code>/help chatcolor</code> to get help on its usage.</li>
    
    <li>A <code>/marker</code> command that allows players to add "points of interest" to the
    overviewer. <a href="http://www.sargunster.com/btwforum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=6122&p=109734#p109734">Read Details &gt;&gt;</a></li>

<h3>Changes to the World:</h3>

<ul class="padded">
    
    <li>Squid spawning has been limited so it cannot drastically pass the spawn limit when a lot of ocean chunks are loaded.
    This was causing a lot of needless tick time.</li>
    
    <li>When wolves are bred, there is a chance that the baby will be born wild! It has become difficult
    to find wolves on our server without going far out, so this should help. Note: wolves can only be bred by their owners.</li>
    
    <li>Spawn is no longer always loaded. Many of us don't spend time there anyway,
    so might as well prevent it from using up resources.</li>
    
    <li>Several community areas near spawn are protected from anything that may change them.</li>
    
    <li>Chunks are randomly checked to see if they are not in range of a player (i.e. not within the 17x17 chunk range).
    If they are found to be out of range of a player, they are unloaded. This is done to avoid the large number of
    chunks that get stuck loaded over time.</li>
    
    <li>The spawn point is forced to always be at a specific location (the dock at the Time's End tavern) as well
    as a specific yaw and pitch (aka: the direction the player is looking).</li>
</ul>
